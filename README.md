# My-Resume
This repository contains the source code for my personal online resume. It is a static website built with HTML to showcase my professional background, projects, and contact information.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main files and directories:

-   `index.html`: The main landing page of the resume.
-   `public/`: This directory contains all supplementary pages.
    -   `projects.html`: A dedicated page to showcase my projects.
    -   `Hobbies.html`: A page detailing my personal hobbies and interests.
    -   `contact.html`: My contact information page.
-   `images/`: Contains all images used throughout the website.

## How to View

To view the resume locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
