    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>XML Parser & Graph Generator </li></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                          Designed and implemented a modular XML parser supporting tag validation, formatting, and  
structure correction.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                          Built a Qt-based GUI editor with real-time syntax highlighting, output display, and 
generated .dot filesand visual graphs using Graphviz.   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed both command-line and graphical interfaces to support diverse user interaction 
styles.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Applied data structure principles for hierarchical parsing and graph generation for extracting 
user and post relationships from XML for user indexing and post search

                    <li>
                          Process creation and control using fork(), exec(), and wait()    
                    </li>
                    <li>
